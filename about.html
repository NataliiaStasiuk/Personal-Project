  <div id="about-col-3">
<p><big>I was born and raised in the small town of the West of Ukraine. In order to get a better education I left home and went to boarding school at the age of ten. My senior year of high shcool I spent on the exchange program in the USA, where I lived with a host family and went to American school for ten months. As a result, being for so long on my own, far away from home, have made me very independent and responsible.</big></p></div>
